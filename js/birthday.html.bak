Your birthdate describes who you are, what you are good at, and what your inborn abilities are.
It also points to what you have to learn, and the challenges you are facing. 
<br><br>
Your birthday number
is calculated by adding the numbers of your birthday over and over again, until only one digit is
left. For example, if you were born on February 15, 1956, it would be 2 + 15 + 1956 = 1973, then
1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20, then 2 + 0 = 2. So your birthday number would be 2.
<br><br>
Your birthday number will never prevent you from being anything you want, it will just color
your choices differently.

What Your Birthday Number Means
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#1 - The Originator</b><br>
You are an original. Coming up with new ideas and executing them
is natural to you. Having things your own way also seems natural, but
may get you
labeled as stubborn and arrogant. You are extremely honest, so
you may have to work extra hard on diplomacy skills. You like to take the
initiative and are probably a leader or a boss, as you like to be the
best. Being self-employed is a good choice for you. Lesson to learn: Others' 
ideas might be just as good or better than your own, so stay open-minded.
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #1's:</b><br>
Tom Hanks, Robert Redford, Hulk Hogan, Carol Burnett, Wynonna Judd,
Nancy Reagan, Raquel Welch
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#2 - The Peacemaker</b><br>
You are a born diplomat. You are aware of others' needs and moods,
and often think of others before yourself. Naturally analytical and 
intuitive, you don't like to be alone. Friendship and companionship
are very important to you, and can lead you to be successful in life, 
but you would rather be alone than in an uncomfortable relationship. 
Being naturally shy, you should learn to boost your self-esteem and 
express yourself freely.  Don't put things off; seize the moment.
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #2's:</b><br>
President Bill Clinton, Madonna, Whoopie Goldberg, Thomas Edison,
Wofgang Amadeus Mozart
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#3 - The Life of the Party</b><br>
You are an idealist. You are very creative, social, charming, romantic,
 and easygoing. You start many things, but don't always see them through.
You like others to be happy, and will go to great lengths to keep them
that way. You are very popular and idealistic. You may need to learn to
see the world from a more realistic point of view.
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #3's:</b><br>
Alan Alda, Ann Landers, Bill Cosby, Melanie Griffith, Salvador Dali,
Jodie Foster  
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#4 - The Conservative</b><br>
You are sensible and traditional. You like order and routine. You only
act when you fully understand what you are expected to do. You like 
getting your hands dirty and working hard. You are attracted to the
outdoors, and you feel an affinity with nature. You are prepared to 
wait for the things you want; you could be considered to be stubborn 
and persistent. One thing you could work on is your flexibility (or
lack of it), and you should always remember to be nice to yourself. 
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #4's:</b><br>
Neil Diamond, Margaret Thatcher, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tina Turner,
Paul Hogan, Oprah Winfrey
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#5 - The Non-Conformist</b><br>
You are an explorer. Your natural curiosity, risk taking, and
enthusiasm often land you in hot water. You need diversity; you don't
like to be stuck in a rut. The whole world is your school, and you see
a learning possibility in every situation. Your questions never stop. 
You should learn to look before you take action, and make sure you have
all the facts before you jump to conclusions.
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #5's:</b><br>
Abraham Lincoln, Charlotte Bronte, Jessica Walter, Vincent van Gogh,
Bette Midler, Helen Keller
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#6 - The Romantic</b><br>
You are idealistic, and you need to feel useful in order to be happy.
A strong family connection is important to you. Your emotions often
influence your decisions. You have a strong urge to take care of and 
help others. You are very loyal; you take friendship very seriously.
You like art and/or music, and would probably make a good teacher.
You need to work on your ability to distinguish between the things you
can and cannot change. 
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #6's:</b><br>
Albert Einstein, Jane Seymour, John Denver, Meryl Streep, Christopher
Columbus, Goldie Hawn   
<br><br>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#7 - The Intellectual</b><br>
You are a searcher. Always probing for hidden information, you find it
difficult to accept things at face value. Emotions don't sway your
decisions. Questioning everything in life, you don't like to be 
questioned yourself. You're never off to a fast start; your motto is 
'slow and steady wins the race'. You come across as being very
knowledgeable and somewhat of a philosopher, and maybe somewhat of a
loner. You are technically inclined, and you love to uncover secrets. 
That combination makes you a great researcher. Your only problem is
that you live in your own world. You need to learn what is acceptable
in the world at large.
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #7's:</b><br>
William Shakespeare, Lucille Ball, Michael Jackson, Joan Baez, Princess
Diana
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#8 - The Big Shot</b><br>
You are a problem solver. You are professional, blunt, and to the point.
You have good judgement and are very decisive. You have grandiose
plans, and you like to live the good life. You are a 'take-charge'  
person. You view people objectively, but you let them know in no uncertain
terms that you are the boss. The thing you need to work on is basing
your decisions on your own needs rather than the needs of others.  
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #8's:</b><br>
Barbra Streisand, George Harrison, Jane Fonda, Pablo Picasso, Aretha
Franklin, Nostradamus  
<br><br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#000080">
<b>#9 - The Performer</b><br>
You are a natural entertainer. You are very caring and generous, giving
away your last dollar to help someone. With your charm, you have no
problem making friends; no one is a stranger to you. You have so many
different personalities that people around you have a hard time
understanding you sometimes. You are like a chamelion, ever changing
and blending in. You have tremendous luck, but can also suffer from 
extremes in fortune and mood. To be successful, you will need to 
build a loving foundation.
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="ms sans serif" color="#002020">
<b>Famous #9's:</b><br>
Albert Schweitzer, Shirley MacLaine, Harrison Ford, Gloria Steinem, 
Jimmy Carter, Elvis Presley
